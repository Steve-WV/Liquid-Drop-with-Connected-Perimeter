# Liquid Drop Model with Connected Perimeter

Implementation of an Ohta-Kawasaki phase field approximation of the liquid drop model with an additional connectedness constraint on the perimeter of a set.

The repo provides the **C-++**â€“implementation of the numerical experiments conducted in [[1]](#1). 

The development of the software in **C++** was done by **<a href = https://aam.uni-freiburg.de/mitarb/wolffvorbeck/index.html>Steve Wolff-Vorbeck<a/>** (**University of Freiburg**) on the basis of a finite element software package created by **Prof. Patrick Dondl** (**University of Freiburg**).

For more details on the usage of the code please check the **"README.txt"** file.
