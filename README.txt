Guidelines how to use the code: 

REQUIREMENTS:
 - Cmake version no less than 3.7.2
 - A suitable C++ compiler
 - The linear algebra library Eigen
 - The Boost libraries
 - Suitesparse library


Here, the path to the suitesparse library is set to "/usr/include/suitesparse" in the CMakeLists. Before building makefiles, set the appropriate path according to your system!  

After compilation using cmake and make, a target called "s2d" is produced 
which can be executed by: s2d -f [path to]/square1.obj

By this the simulation is started on the reference domain Omega=[0,1]^2.

The main code of the simulation is provided in the executable 
file "pde.cpp". Here the relevant parameters are described 
in lines 18-28, where e.g. the scaling parameter sigma for the non-local repulsive term 
and the interfacial parameter epsilon can be changed 
in order to simulate certain gradient flows.
